###Lives
Your lives are shown along the bottom of the game board. You begin with 5 lives. Running into a bug or falling into the river will cause you to lose a life.

Lose all your lives and the game is over!

###Scoring
Every jump your player makes will earn 10-points. Successfully crossing the road and reaching the grass landing will earn 1,000 points!

###Levels
The first level will only provide 1 enemy bug. However, each time you successfully reach the opposite side of the road you will achieve a new level. Each new level will add a new bug and increase the speed of some bugs! 

Be careful, the higher the level the more bugs to challenge your adventure!
